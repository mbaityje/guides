# Openings for new positions

## Writing the opening

### Template

You can find a template in this page.

### Tools

- To tailor the text for a better **minority inclusion**, check out this website `https://diversifier.witty.works`

- To look for synonims use `thesaurus.com`


## Getting the opening out

Once the opening is written, send it to `recruiting@eawag.ch`.
They will have a look at it, publish the job advertisement and put it on refline.
