# Getting permission to put your data on ERIC

- First thing to do is log in to eric, and then log back out again. This will initialize your account.  

- Once that’s done, Marco can add you to the approved editors for his lab group. (@Baity Jesi, Marco – see https://opendata.eawag.ch/eawagrdm/help/quickstart.html#permissions_screencast for instructions)
 
- After that you can follow the instructions here
 
	- Once you have made  the datapackage, send me the link to the datapackage and I will reserve a DOI for you to put in your manuscript.  The DOI wont work until we publish the datapackage, but once its reserved it wont change so you can safely include it in the MS.
 
	- To share data with reviewers, I recommend using your switchdrive and sharing an anonymous link.  – this is only for the review process though.  Just put a note in your submission coverletter explaining that the review data link is temporary and that the data will be available at the DOI when the paper is accepted.
