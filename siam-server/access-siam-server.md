# Accessing SIAM server


Once you have your VPN installed and activated (or anytime you are in the building), you can access the siam servers by doing on your terminal

```
ssh yourusername@siam-linux20
```


Of course, `siam-linux20` is only one of the machines. According to your needs and permissions (ask your supervisor about it), a different machine will apply.
