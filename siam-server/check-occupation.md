# Checking SIAM server occupation



There is a webpage where we can see the CPU usage of the SIAM server machines (you can ignore the security warning):

If you are connected to the siam machines, you can type `process_counter` on the command line, and you will see how many cores are occupied and by whom.


### Organization

There is an organization sheet in the Q drive,
```
Q:\Abteilungsprojekte\siam\SiamServerUsage.xlsx 
```
where you can reserve your usage.
