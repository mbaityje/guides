# VPN


## Permissions

First of all, you need to get the permissions.

Email Mathias Bothe (Mathias.Bothe@eawag.ch) attaching the form in this directory (`VPN_form.pdf`) that I am attaching to this email.
Use your eawag account and put your group leader in cc:.

## Installation

Connect to the intranet, internal.eawag.ch, and type vpn in the search engine. Otherwise, just open this file, which contains the instructions:
https://webvpn.eawag.ch/https/www.internal.eawag.ch/fileadmin_intranet/intranet/informatik/komm_kanaele/extern/pa_global_protect_winmac_e.pdf

If you are not at Eawag, you can still access the intranet by logging into https://webvpn.eawag.ch/global-protect/portal/portal.esp

If you have **mac** or **windows**, you simply download the VPN program from vpn.eawag.ch, and follow the instructions.

If you have **linux**, the program is hidden at this path:
https://www.eawag.ch/repository/pa_gp_client/

and you can find the instructions here.
